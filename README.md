# python_api_challenge

The folder "WeatherPy_VacationPy" has the code for the weather and vacation parts of the assignments. The output figures and csv file for the weather part of the assignment are in the folder "output_data" within the "WeatherPy_VacationPy". WeatherPy.ipynb has the code and output for the weather part of the assignment, and VacationPy.ipynb has the code and output for the vacation part of the assignment (except for the two maps becuase they do not appear in the preview in github, the code will need to be run for them to be displayed). For both parts of the assignment I used the given starter code and added my code to this, I have noted in the code when I got code else where.
